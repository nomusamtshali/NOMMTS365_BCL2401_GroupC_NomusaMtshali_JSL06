# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

# Project Overview

- In this project, I had to build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal was to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. I applied various JavaScript concepts, including functions, closures, and event handling, to create an interactive menu.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- Being able to create and use functions effectively.

## Challenges Faced

- I struggled with implementing the code that updates the order total and the list of ordered items as the user makes selections.

## Areas of improvement

- I want to focus on improving my coding style, following best practices such as proper indentation and variable naming.

# Overall Learning Experience

- This project was a great opportunity to learn about JavaScript, and specifically about working with arrays and events. By completing this project, I gained experience with functions, closures, event handling, and other fundamental JavaScript concepts. I know that I'll also get the chance to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario (e.g building my own projects).
