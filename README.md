# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

**JavaScript Implementation**: Use the provided starter code in `index.js` as a foundation for your application. The starter code contains placeholders for key functions and comments to guide you through the implementation.

    - `menu`: The `menu` object contains sample menu data, including categories and items. You can expand this menu with more items if needed.

    - `displayMenuItems(menu)`: This function should dynamically create and display menu items grouped by category. Iterate over the `menu` object and create HTML elements for each category and item. Attach event listeners to the menu items to handle adding items to the order.

    - `addToOrder(itemName)`: Implement this callback function to update the order summary when an item is added. You can use closures to maintain the state of the order. Calculate and update the total price accordingly.

    - `initMenuSystem(menu)`: Call the `displayMenuItems` function with the menu data and attach event listeners to menu items.

# Project Overview

- In this project, I had to build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal was to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click. I applied various JavaScript concepts, including functions, closures, and event handling, to create an interactive menu.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

## Areas of Mastery

-

## Challenges Faced

- I struggled with implementing the code that updates the order total and the list of ordered items as the user makes selections.

## Areas of improvement

-

# Overall Learning Experience

- This project was a great opportunity to learn about JavaScript, and specifically about working with arrays and events. By completing this project, I gained experience with functions, closures, event handling, and other fundamental JavaScript concepts. I know that I'll also get the chance to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario (e.g building my own projects).
